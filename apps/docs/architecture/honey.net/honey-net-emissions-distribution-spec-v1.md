🟡 Honey.net Emission & Distribution Schedule (FINAL DRAFT)
1️⃣ Core Principles (Locked)

These are non-negotiable constraints:

Fixed supply: 1,000,000,000 HNY (minted at genesis)

No protocol inflation

All rewards come from pre-allocated pools + gas fees

Long-term security transitions to fee-dominant model

DAO-controlled emergency levers only

2️⃣ Reward Sources Overview

Validators & stakers are paid from three sources:

A. Staking / Validator Allocation

350,000,000 HNY

Finite

Time-released

B. Transaction Gas Fees

Percentage-based

Dynamically adjusted (EIP-1559–style)

Permanent

C. Slashing & Penalties

Recycled into rewards pools

3️⃣ Emission Phases
🔹 Phase 0 — Genesis Bootstrapping

Duration: Launch → Month 3
Goal: Network security & validator onboarding

Higher per-block rewards

Faucet + devnet usage allowed

Centralized guardrails permitted

Emission rate:

~6% of validator pool annually (front-loaded)

🔹 Phase 1 — Early Growth

Duration: Months 3–18
Goal: Decentralization + ecosystem growth

Validators compete on uptime & latency

Staking APY gradually declines

Gas fees become meaningful

Emission rate:

~5% annually, linearly decaying

🔹 Phase 2 — Network Maturity

Duration: Months 18–48
Goal: Fee-dominant security

Validator rewards mostly gas-based

Staking emissions taper hard

Treasury begins to grow via gas

Emission rate:

~2–3% annually, decaying

🔹 Phase 3 — Post-Emission Era

Duration: ~Year 4+

No scheduled emissions

Rewards = gas + penalties only

Validator pool preserved for:

Emergency security

Governance-approved releases

4️⃣ Concrete Numbers (Validator Pool)
Total pool
350,000,000 HNY

Example 4-Year Distribution
Year	% Released	HNY
Year 1	6%	21,000,000
Year 2	5%	17,500,000
Year 3	3%	10,500,000
Year 4	2%	7,000,000
Total (4y)	16%	56,000,000

➡ Leaves 294,000,000 HNY untouched

This is extremely conservative — by design.

5️⃣ Per-Block Reward Logic (No Minting)

Each block distributes from released allowance, not new supply.

Example block reward split:
Block Reward = 0.05 HNY (from released pool)
+ Gas Fees Collected


Distribution:

60% → Block proposer

40% → Attesters

(Values illustrative — chain-tunable)

6️⃣ Gas Fee Distribution (Locked)

Gas is permanent income:

Destination	%
Validators	60%
Staking Pool	30%
Treasury / DAO	10%

Gas is not burned (unless DAO opts in later).

7️⃣ Staking Rewards Flow

Stakers earn from:

Validator emissions

30% of gas fees

Slashing redistribution

No staking = no rewards
Idle tokens earn nothing

8️⃣ Slashing & Recycling

When a validator:

Double signs

Goes offline

Censors transactions

Penalty flow:

50% → Staking pool

30% → Treasury

20% → Burn (optional / DAO-controlled)

9️⃣ DAO Safety Valves (Hard-Capped)

DAO may:

Adjust emission rate (not supply)

Pause emissions in emergencies

Redirect treasury rewards

Enable fee burns

DAO may NOT:

Increase total supply

Create inflation

Bypass hard caps

🔒 FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

Honey.net distributes rewards from pre-minted allocations and transaction fees.
No new HNY is ever minted after genesis.
Network security transitions from subsidized emissions to fee-based incentives over time.
